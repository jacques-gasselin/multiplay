Design
======

Each platform defines its own API and ecosystem for managing Players and Games. Most of them are incompatible and have severe platform bugs. This framework move the responsibility of fixing the bugs to the community and to allow cross platform gaming.

Connect the Game
=================

Call the API with the game server URL and the game UUID. The UUID is purely a token that the server and client has agreed upon. GameConnectionToken is returned that is used for all communication between the game and the server from this point onward.

***********************************************
* .--------.                        .--------.
* |        +----connect:gameUUID--->|        |
* |  Game  |                        | Server |
* |        |<----connectionUUID-----+        |
* '--------'                        '--------'
*
***********************************************

Client Side:

   *Request*:
   
   GET *ServerURI*/connect?game=*Game UUID*
   
   *Response*:
   
   connectionToken : UUID

Server Side:

*Lookup game UUID in database*
*If not found return an empty UUID*
*If found generate a connection UUID, that does not clash with other current or stale connnections, with a timeout*
*Clear out all stale connections for the game UUID*
*Return the connection UUID*

This handshake allows the server to manage load and by assigning tokens
it can ensure that only active connections are serviced in case of
rogue clients.


Connecting the player
===================

Use the GameConnectionToken to create a player, or fetch the last used player, with the localDeviceUUID.
For iOS this would be the same as [[UIDevice currentDevice].identifierForVendor UUIDString]

Client Side:

   *Request*:
   
   GET *ServerURI*/login?connection=*connectionToken*&localDevice=*localDeviceUUID*
   
   *Response*:
   
   playerToken : UUID

Server Side:

   SELECT P.playerToken, P.connectionTime, P.deviceUUID
   FROM playerTokenConnectionTimeAndDeviceUUIDByConnectionToken AS P
   WHERE P.connectionToken = $connectionToken

   1. Resolve if there are stale connections based on the connection time being stale.
      Remove the stale connections from the table so that no more requests are serviced on
      a stale connection
   1. If there are multiple connections invalidate all that are not for the given device id
   1. If there is a valid connection for the given device return that and refresh the connection time.
   1. If there are no connections insert a new unique one into the table and return that playerToken.
      This involves selecting from the playerByDevice Table and returning a token for the last used
      player for that device.
      Or if there are no players associated with that device returning a new one.
      Note that there may be multiple tokens for a single player. Such that play can begin under one
      anonymous player and then be merged by some authenticated login to another existing player.
      This is a common game affordace to avoid locking a player into a login flow when they first start a game.

This flow relies on the game being able to provide a stable UUID for the device. If a user has chose to forget settings on the device the UUID should have been regenerated and a new anonymous login would occurr.

Saving Data
===========
A game will often want to save data for the player in the cloud. With a valid connectionToken and playerToken we should be abe to save a binary blob of data.

Client Side:

   *Request*:
   
   POST *ServerURI*/savePlayerData?connetion=*connectionToken*&player=*playerToken*
   
   *Reponse*
   
   status : Bool

Loading Data
============
Retrieve a blob of player data for the game.

Client Side:

   *Request*:
   
   GET *ServerURI*/loadPlayerData?connection=*connectionToken*&player=*playerToken*
   
   *Response*
   
   data : Data

The returned data will be empty if there was no data to retrieve. The potential for an error in the connection may be needed too to have a status.


Starting a Session
==================
A session is a server state instance than can be shared among players. This is used for saving data in a shared game. As this is possibly shared among players the easiest way to manage atomicity is to treat it like a key value store. There exists a binary blob for each key. There is no merging of data, and last in wins if two connections write to the same key.

Client Side:

   *Request*
   
   GET *ServerURI*/createSession?connection=*connectionToken*&player=*playerToken*
   
   *Response*
   
   sessionToken : UUID

Server Side:

   1. Create a new session for the player.


Add a player to a session
=========================
A session is created with only one player, the only way to add players is to invite them.

Client Side:

   *Request*
   
   GET *ServerURI*/addPlayerToSession?connection=*connectionToken*&session=*sessionToken*&player=*playerToken*
   Note: *playerToken* in this case is the token of the other player to add to the session.
   
   *Response*
   
   status : BOOL

Remove a player from a session
==============================


Write State to a Session
========================


Read State from a Session
=========================


Create Peer-to-Peer Connection with Player in Session
=====================================================

Client Side:

   *Request*
   
   GET *ServerURI*/connectToPlayerInSession?connection=*connectionToken*&session=*sessionToken*&player=*playerToken*
   
   *Response*
   
   address,port : INETADDR

This connection may be truly peer-to-peer but if reachability is an issue it may be tunneled through the server. An implementation detail the client does not need to worry about.
